# Data-ML-AI
In the folder there are several projects related to Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

The libraries and tools used are _scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, tensorflow, etc._ 

Project run at [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) , [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp).

Below are some of my projects that I have made and practiced, you can see the results and descriptions of my projects:

- [Detect Labels, Faces, and Landmarks in Images with the Cloud Vision API](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20Project/Detect%20Labels%2C%20Faces%2C%20and%20Landmarks%20in%20Images%20with%20the%20Cloud%20Vision%20API): The Cloud Vision API lets you understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in a simple REST API. We will send images to the Vision API and see it detect objects, faces, and landmarks. This project using Google Cloud Platform.
- [Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Attrition Data](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/blob/main/Data/Project%202/EDA_for_ML.ipynb): For this project, I am using IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset that can be obtained on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). This dataset is about employee attrition data. Employee Attrition is the gradual reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced. This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists.
- [Coronavirus (COVID-19) Visualization & Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/sardiirfansyah/covid-19-visualization-prediction ): in this project, I tried Exploring Global Coronavirus Cases,Exploring Coronavirus Cases From Different Countries,Worldwide Confirmed Cases Prediction & Visualization.
- [Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Data/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20using%20Machine%20Learning): The tasks in this project are: Perform Exploration Data Analysis, Perform Data Processing, Performing Machine Learning modeling, and Determining the Best Model.
- [Data Science in Telco Data Cleansing](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Data/Data%20Science%20in%20Telco%20Data%20Cleansing ): The task in this project is to perform data processing (data cleansing), namely: Finding a valid customer ID (phone number), Overcoming blank data (Missing Values), Addressing the Outliers of each Variable and Standardization of Variable Values.
- [Developed artificial neural networks for Time Series problems using LSTM](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/time_series/blob/main/time_series_LSTM.ipynb):This project uses the delhi weather dataset and will create a sequential model and LSTM and see the MAE value.
- [Implementing neural networks working on NLP (Natural Language Processing)](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/NLP-Dicoding):This project aims to create NLP with LSTM in architecture as well as a sequential model.
- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/blob/main/boston_housing): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
- [Create a Chabot With SAP Conversational AI](https://developers.sap.com/mission.cai-get-started.html): Create AI chatbots that are able to answer customer questions automatically. You can test my project and see the results of the project that have been made in viewing on my website https://sardiirfan27.github.io/
- [An Automated Supply Chain Scenario Using IBM Watson](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/IBM%20Watson%20Projects(Data%20Science%2C%20AI%2C%20ML)/An%20Automated%20Supply%20Chain%20Scenario): In this project we will focus on analyzing how effective the supply chain is for retail department stores. This automated supply chain scenario will provide insight into the data and processes of the supply chain organization, in an attempt to isolate the causes of poor delivery performance.
- [Recognize hand shapes with machine learning](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/ML): Recognize the shape of the hand that forms scissors, rock, or paper.
- [Iris Predictor with Deep Learning | Web App](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Iris-Species-Predictor-ML-Web-App): Create a web application to detect iris species.
- [Predict Loan Repayment](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/predict-loan-repayment-master): Predict whether a loan will be repaid using automated feature engineering.
- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Analyzing_Customer_Spending_Data): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
- [NLP (Natural Language Processing): 3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/blob/main/3Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
