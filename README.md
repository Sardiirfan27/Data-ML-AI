# Data-ML-AI
In the folder there are several projects related to Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Project run at https://colab.research.google.com/ , IBM Watson Studio (https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/) and Google Cloud Platform (https://cloud.google.com/gcp).
here are some of the projects in that folder:

- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
- [An Automated Supply Chain Scenario Using IBM Watson](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML AI/tree/main/IBM%20Watson%20Projects(Data%20Science%2C%20AI%2C%20ML)/An%20Automated%20Supply%20Chain%20Scenario): In this project we will focus on analyzing how effective the supply chain is for retail department stores. This automated supply chain scenario will provide insight into the data and processes of the supply chain organization, in an attempt to isolate the causes of poor delivery performance.
- [Recognize hand shapes with machine learning](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/ML): Recognize the shape of the hand that forms scissors, rock, or paper.
- [Iris Predictor with Deep Learning | Web App](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Iris-Species-Predictor-ML-Web-App): Create a web application to detect iris species.
- [A Detailed Regression With House Pricing Prediction](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Data/Project%201): Do a comprehensive data analysis along with visualizations. Create models that are well equipped to predict better sale price of the houses.
- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Analyzing_Customer_Spending_Data): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
