- [Extract, Analyze, and Translate Text from Images with the Cloud ML APIs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/1836?parent=catalog): I did this project when I joined the #JuaraGCP challenge from the Google Cloud Platform. In this project I have Made a Vision API request and called the API with curl, Using the text detection like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) method of the Vision API, Using the Translate API to translate text from your image and Using the Natural Language API to analyze text.
- [Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Data/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20using%20Machine%20Learning): The tasks in this project are: Perform Exploration Data Analysis, Perform Data Processing, Performing Machine Learning modeling, and Determining the Best Model.
- [Data Science in Telco Data Cleansing](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Data/Data%20Science%20in%20Telco%20Data%20Cleansing ): The task in this project is to perform data processing (data cleansing), namely: Finding a valid customer ID (phone number), Overcoming blank data (Missing Values), Addressing the Outliers of each Variable and Standardization of Variable Values.
- [Design Conversational Flows for your Agent using DialogFlow GCP](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12347?parent=catalog): Contact Center AI can increase customer satisfaction and operational efficiency by improving call deflection rates, and achieve shorter handling, while making overall operations faster and more effective. I have used Dialogflow to create a conversation interface and perform the following tasks:  Design end-user's intentions, Build conversation agent for online travel agency, Define intent for our online travel agency use case to match typical user queries
- [Developed artificial neural networks for Time Series problems using LSTM](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/time_series/blob/main/time_series_LSTM.ipynb):This project uses the delhi weather dataset and will create a sequential model and LSTM and see the MAE value.
- [Implementing neural networks working on NLP (Natural Language Processing)](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/NLP-Dicoding):This project aims to create NLP with LSTM in architecture as well as a sequential model.
-- [Data Science in Marketing Customer Segmentation with Python)](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-Science-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Project%20%26%20Implementation/Data_Science_in_Marketing_Customer_Segmentation_with_Python.ipynb):The goal is that the company can make a marketing strategy that is more precise and efficient for each customer. One of the techniques that can be used is the application of machine learning using the K-Prototypes algorithm. The K-Prototypes algorithm is a combination of K-Means and K-Modes which can be used to segment data.Namely by classifying existing customers based on the similarity of the characters of these customers.
- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/blob/main/boston_housing): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
- [Create a Chabot With SAP Conversational AI](https://developers.sap.com/mission.cai-get-started.html): Create AI chatbots that are able to answer customer questions automatically. You can test my project and see the results of the project that have been made in viewing on my website https://sardiirfan27.github.io/
- [An Automated Supply Chain Scenario Using IBM Watson](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/IBM%20Watson%20Projects(Data%20Science%2C%20AI%2C%20ML)/An%20Automated%20Supply%20Chain%20Scenario): In this project we will focus on analyzing how effective the supply chain is for retail department stores.
