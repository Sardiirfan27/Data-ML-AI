# Data-ML-AI
In the folder there are several projects related to Data Science, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

The libraries and tools used are _scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, tensorflow, etc._ 

Project run at [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) , [IBM Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/) and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp).

Below are some of my projects that I have made and practiced, you can see the results and descriptions of my projects:

- [Detect Labels, Faces, and Landmarks in Images with the Cloud Vision API](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20Project/Detect%20Labels%2C%20Faces%2C%20and%20Landmarks%20in%20Images%20with%20the%20Cloud%20Vision%20API): The Cloud Vision API lets you understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in a simple REST API. we will send images to the Vision API and see it detect objects, faces, and landmarks.
- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/blob/main/boston_housing): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
- [Create a Chabot With SAP Conversational AI](https://developers.sap.com/mission.cai-get-started.html): Create AI chatbots that are able to answer customer questions automatically. You can test my project and see the results of the project that have been made in viewing on my website https://sardiirfan27.github.io/
- [An Automated Supply Chain Scenario Using IBM Watson](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/IBM%20Watson%20Projects(Data%20Science%2C%20AI%2C%20ML)/An%20Automated%20Supply%20Chain%20Scenario): In this project we will focus on analyzing how effective the supply chain is for retail department stores. This automated supply chain scenario will provide insight into the data and processes of the supply chain organization, in an attempt to isolate the causes of poor delivery performance.
- [Recognize hand shapes with machine learning](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/ML): Recognize the shape of the hand that forms scissors, rock, or paper.
- [Iris Predictor with Deep Learning | Web App](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Iris-Species-Predictor-ML-Web-App): Create a web application to detect iris species.
- [Predict Loan Repayment](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/predict-loan-repayment-master): Predict whether a loan will be repaid using automated feature engineering.
- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Analyzing_Customer_Spending_Data): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
- [NLP (Natural Language Processing): 3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/blob/main/3Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.
- [A Detailed Regression With House Pricing Prediction](https://github.com/Sardiirfan27/Data-ML-AI/tree/main/Data/Project%201): Do a comprehensive data analysis along with visualizations. Create models that are well equipped to predict better sale price of the houses.
